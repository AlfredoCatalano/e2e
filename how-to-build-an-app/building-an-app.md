The best approach when building an app is to employ a professional app development team or firm who showcase a range of expertise. When choosing a developer firm, it is important to consider their reputation, reviews and portfolio. But bear in mind, when it comes to app development cheaper is not always better, and this is generally reflected in the quality of the app.

A recent survey by Clutch revealed that the cost of mobile app development ranges between $30,000 to $700,000, with a calculated median cost of $171,450. If budget is a concern, it may be worthwhile looking into an app development platform rather than a custom development approach.

Every app must have a proper blueprint outlining what's being built, the resources required, and a timeline for development. With a blueprint for an app in place, a development team can get started having a foundation.

Once you've got the system architecture right, the next step is framing your app by building out the screens and how a user will move through your app. This process is called wire framing.

**System Architecture**
- Cloud Provider
- Databases
- Message Brokers

The wireframe for your app helps you think through the navigation and what each screen will eventually look like before development work starts. Once you've got the wireframe for your app, it's time to start thinking about how to wire it up. This means adding the features and functionality your app will need.

- Navigation
- Screens

Half of apps built require integration with other utilities. Modern apps rely on external services and other utilities to add features, like sharing content on Facebook, adding payment processing to an app, or displaying maps based on a user's current location.

**Integration**
- 3rd Party APIs

Making your app look world-class takes a lot of effort and the right team. Every detail must be evaluated. Every color much compliment. Every button must be pixel perfect. If done right, youâ€™ve got a lot of happy folks.
