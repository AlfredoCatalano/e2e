The best approach when building an app is to employ a professional app development team or firm who showcase a range of expertise. When choosing a developer firm, it is important to consider their reputation, reviews and portfolio. But bear in mind, when it comes to app development cheaper is not always better, and this is generally reflected in the quality of the app.

A recent survey by Clutch revealed that the cost of mobile app development ranges between $30,000 to $700,000, with a calculated median cost of $171,450. If budget is a concern, it may be worthwhile looking into an app development platform rather than a custom development approach.

Every app must have a proper blueprint outlining what's being built, the resources required, and a timeline for development. With a blueprint for an app in place, a development team can get started having a foundation.

- Scope
- Cost
- Time

Once you've got the system architecture right, the next step is framing your app by building out the screens and how a user will move through your app. This process is called wire framing.

**System Architecture**
- Cloud Provider
- Databases
- Message Brokers

The wireframe for your app helps you think through the navigation and what each screen will eventually look like before development work starts. Once you've got the wireframe for your app, it's time to start thinking about how to wire it up. This means adding the features and functionality your app will need.

- Navigation
- Screens

Half of apps built require integration with other utilities. Modern apps rely on external services and other utilities to add features, like sharing content on Facebook, adding payment processing to an app, or displaying maps based on a user's current location.

**Integration**
- 3rd Party APIs

Making your app look world-class takes a lot of effort and the right team. Every detail must be evaluated. Every color much compliment. Every button must be pixel perfect. If done right, youâ€™ve got a lot of happy folks. 

**UI Design**
- Colors
- Fonts

After development, it is important to test the app for functionality, performance and optimisation. Once a version of the app is completed, beta testing (or user testing) can commence. This is a crucial element of app development, therefore it is important to check that any contract with a development team includes beta testing. During this stage, the app is examined under various conditions to ensure it is bug-free and that users are comfortable with the interface. Android beta testing is a somewhat simple process, the app file is uploaded onto any android device and tested live. iOS, on the other hand, prefers to test in a controlled environment. Consequently, iOS requires the use of the platform TestFlight in order to test the app.

- Functionality Testing


The app is finally finished, tested and ready to launch! It is important to understand that publishing an app to the marketplace is a process that may take a couple of weeks. This is due to the fact that each iOS app is manually reviewed before the app can go live. Apple may also request changes to the app during this time. On the other hand, apps can be added to the Android Google Play store instantly and might not be reviewed straight away. However, in order to publish and sell the app, developer accounts will need to be created for the respective app marketplace(s). These accounts can be registered as an individual or company, and are charged as a yearly fee.

**App Launch**
- Publishing
- Review

After launching the app, it is important to gather user feedback. This will help guide any future app updates, as well as ensuring app functionality and usability. It is also important to utilise analytics in order to track app performance. Inbuilt app analytics allows businesses to track downloads, user engagement and retention. This usage behaviour will help provide insight into how to improve the app and enhance the user experience.

**Post-Launch**
