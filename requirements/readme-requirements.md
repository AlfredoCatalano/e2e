As Information Technology (IT) professionals we have a responsibility to provide the best technical value to our customers. From the single IT staff member of a small company, to the Chief Information Officer (CIO) at a multi-national enterprise, our customers place most (if not all) aspects surrounding technology in our hands - with the expectation that we meet the requirements in the best possible way.

In order to live up to those expectations, we have to gain a full understanding of the current and planned needs our customer has in mind. Additionally, we have the realization that any solution we implement has the ability to perform and scale as the business matures and grows.

Being technology agnostic requires the technologist to be able to step back far enough to gain a full understanding of what is required to meet the customer's needs. In fact, this concept of stepping back really means to step outside the box while in the discovery phase - to understand the landscape of potential solutions which may help meet the established requirements.

The biggest challenge IT professionals often face in this regard, is with ourselves. The idea of enjoying a particular product to the point where you want to explore every aspect defined in the API is not uncommon. However, we have to keep in mind that just because the option exists, doesn't always mean it is the best option.

Being technology agnostic requires the ability to "fall out of love" with whatever technology excites you and take an honest and hard look at the entire set of solutions which can best meet the customer's request. Failure to do so makes you technology nostic (if that's a thing).
