What is GIST

GIST is a framework for breaking up planning into four parts — Goals, Ideas, Steps and Tasks.

Simply put, goals define what we wish to achieve, ideas are hypothetical ways to achieve the goals, steps are mini-projects that implement an idea in parts while validating it, and tasks are the day-to-day activities that implement a step. 

Mixing goals, ideas and tasks in one list is bad on multiple levels; It bloats the list with things that are not tasks, and (worse) prevents goals and ideas from being accomplished — they linger in the task list for months, only to get pushed down by tasks that are less important, but more urgent.

The first order of things is therefore to separate goals and ideas into their own lists. Separating goals, ideas and tasks introduces surprising clarity even for the most mundane of goals.
