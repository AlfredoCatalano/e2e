**What is Reg NMS?**

Reg stands for Regulation and NMS stands for National Market System. It was introduced in 2005 and became law in 2007.

NMS helped investors in an already automating market

Reg NMS is a set of rules that defines how trading works in the U.S. for all listed stocks.

As automated trading increased, NMS ushered in a new era of competition in trading and introduced a   number of important protections for investors.

In 1994, following the introduction of the Unlisted Trading Privileges Act, or UTP, stocks were allowed to trade on any venue. That meant the primary listing exchange was no longer the only exchange on which a ticker could trade.

Reg NMS also mandated market-wide cross-connectivity, allowing for a competitive and distributed market. Then the centrality of the SIP ensured that all participants knewwhere and what price the best bid and offer for each stock was at all times.

NMS also prohibited trade-throughs and crossed markets, ensuring that customer orders were filled at the best prices available, regardless of what exchange each stock is trading on.

Although each of these changes facilitated the adoption of computers in trading, the reality is that computers were already automating much of trading. As Chart 1 shows, the automation and decimalization of markets led to cheaper trading. Automation also hastened the development of statistical arbitrage and quant strategies, which in turn led to more liquidity. In the space of 10 years, spreads fell 88% while liquidity increased nine fold.

NMS = 14 rules to help and protect investors

There are 14 separate “rules” that makeup Reg NMS (see Table 1 below), which are grouped into six main categories with some common themes:

    - **01** Definitions: Rule 600 defines concepts and terms, which is sometimes pivotal to how the later rules work.
    - **02** Fairness in INFORMATION: Rules 601-603 are about reporting trades and quotes to the Securities Information Processors (SIPs), ensuring access to data by exchanges.
    Broker ACCOUNTABILITY: Rules 604-607 are special reporting and trading rules designed to mostly protect retail investors.
    SRO rules: Rules 608 and 609 set rules for what Self Regulating Organizations (SROs) need to do to publicly change rules, including SIP operations.
    Fairness in TRADING: Rules 610-612 cover trading rules like protected quotes, decimal ticks, access fee caps.
    CAT: Rule 613 is relatively new rule, covering the consolidated audit trail (CAT).
