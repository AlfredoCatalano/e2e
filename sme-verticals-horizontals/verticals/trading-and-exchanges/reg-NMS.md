**What is Reg NMS?**

Reg stands for Regulation and NMS stands for National Market System. It was introduced in 2005 and became law in 2007.

NMS helped investors in an already automating market

Reg NMS is a set of rules that defines how trading works in the U.S. for all listed stocks.

As automated trading increased, NMS ushered in a new era of competition in trading and introduced a   number of important protections for investors.

In 1994, following the introduction of the Unlisted Trading Privileges Act, or UTP, stocks were allowed to trade on any venue. That meant the primary listing exchange was no longer the only exchange on which a ticker could trade.

Reg NMS also mandated market-wide cross-connectivity, allowing for a competitive and distributed market. Then the centrality of the SIP ensured that all participants knewwhere and what price the best bid and offer for each stock was at all times.

NMS also prohibited trade-throughs and crossed markets, ensuring that customer orders were filled at the best prices available, regardless of what exchange each stock is trading on.

Although each of these changes facilitated the adoption of computers in trading, the reality is that computers were already automating much of trading. As Chart 1 shows, the automation and decimalization of markets led to cheaper trading. Automation also hastened the development of statistical arbitrage and quant strategies, which in turn led to more liquidity. In the space of 10 years, spreads fell 88% while liquidity increased nine fold.
