Run: Operate and maintain

The run part of the model indicates how much of the IT resource is focused on the everyday operation of the business. Companies call this “business as usual,” “keeping the lights on” or “sustaining IT” spending. Run expenses do not directly increase revenue or achieve new company goals, but they do maintain essential functions and deliver efficiency at the appropriate quality and price for performance.

As companies grow more dependent on IT, it is possible to distinguish core run operations from activities needed to grow or transform the business. These core run functions are typically associated with the continuing operation of the business and tend to be nondiscretionary or fixed expenses. Some of these essential IT activities include:

- Infrastructure and operations
- Security, regulatory and compliance
- Business support
- IT financial management
- Application maintenance
