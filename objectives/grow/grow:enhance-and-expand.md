The grow part of the RGT model refers to how much of the IT resource is focused on developing and enhancing IT systems in support of business growth (typically organic growth or improvements in business processes). They extend existing capabilities, deliver differentiation and provide competitiveness.

Companies that want to expand their market, revenue or influence must expand their products or services. The overall business strategy is therefore focused on growth, not just maintaining existing operations. To support this business objective, CIOs must ensure that there are appropriate capabilities within IT to build on its operational foundation and enhance business opportunities for growth. This is typically reflected by increased discretionary spending for capital projects, upgrading new technologies and working with other stakeholders on improved solutions to business issues.

To provide these capabilities, CIOs can focus on developing these essential grow functions:

- Business process analysis
- PMO/project management
- Solution/application architecture
- Sourcing and procurement
