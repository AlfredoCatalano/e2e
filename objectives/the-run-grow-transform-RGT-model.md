To address digital demand, CIOs need to understand the business priorities and objectives of the company so that IT investments, operating models and operational plans are aligned to enterprise outcomes. This means determining how IT capabilities are expected to run, grow and transform the business in the new digital landscape.

Gartner developed the RGT model to support IT portfolio planning and investment in IT products and services. It also helps CIOs make decisions on the resources and capabilities required to develop, manage and support those IT investments.

CIOs can use this model to review how well current IT functions align with the overall business strategy of the enterprise. First, they must map IT resources across the run, grow and transform categories to provide a high-level view of current capacity, including areas of functional shortfalls or gaps. They can then address these gaps where the companyâ€™s expectations are not aligned with the capabilities and resources within the IT organization.
