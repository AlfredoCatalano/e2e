The transform aspect of the RGT model shows how much of the IT resource is aimed at implementing IT systems that enable the enterprise to enter new markets, address new customer segments, create new value propositions and enact new business models. This is a high-risk, high-reward category.  

As companies mature in the digital age, the expectations on IT from the enterprise will evolve significantly. Transformational companies are looking at IT to deliver innovation, create new sources of revenue, explore new markets, and develop new products and services. CIOs cannot meet these objectives by focusing only on operational or growth capabilities, but must work hand-in-hand with business leaders to ensure IT capabilities can support transformation activities.

The typical transform functions that are now needed in the IT organization include:

- Research and development
- Capital investment management
- Architecture review board
- Rapid solution pilots
- Business architecture
- Digital solutions development
